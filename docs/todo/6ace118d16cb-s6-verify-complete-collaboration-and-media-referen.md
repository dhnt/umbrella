sprint_title: 'Collaboration MVP: consistent app references, KB catalog, and Memos/Calendar discovery'
---

Depends on S2-S5 as applicable. Use existing Desk/reference/browser harnesses and established test hosts; no heavy suites on the dev host. Exercise Klatch -> Session -> KB references -> Memos if already available -> brainstorming/whiteboard/forms -> chart -> recording/transcript/video -> linked Viewer report -> local Git save -> explicit publish -> fresh checkout. Calendar/Memos gaps discovered in S7/S8 must be named as absent/deferred, not reported passing or used to block verification of existing apps. Check scope/permission denial, stale/dangling refs, revision provenance, renamed content, concurrent saves, offline publishing and LFS retrieval. Acceptance: concise per-tool evidence tied to candidate versions; no failures silently skipped; docs distinguish working flows from remaining gaps.

Cross-cutting operator requirement: all Bashy apps/features must support software shaping and follow 'rod, not fish'. Prefer one reusable Bash# (.bsh) command/skill/script wrapper composing existing verbs and external tools; keep each underlying operation independently usable. Put variable behavior in templates/config/formats and name the shaping hook. Write new Go only for a necessary missing primitive/backend, not orchestration that Bash# can express. No one-off classroom, competition, roster or provider coupling. Reuse [[kb:bashy/extend-bashy-small-verbs-bash-skill-scripts-shaping-hooks-and-th]]. Acceptance includes the documented shaping hook and reusable wrapper/contract evidence; discovery stories specify these rather than implementing them.

Agent-first CLI parity (operator requirement): everything a human can see or do in an app, including all administration and management, must also be available through Bashy CLI under equivalent identity, permissions and approval rules. Provide discoverable help, scriptable/noninteractive inputs, structured outputs, stable entity references and actionable errors. Prefer Bash# command/skill wrappers over existing APIs/verbs. A browser-only action or a raw API with no Bashy CLI entry is an integration gap. S1 audits the UI-to-CLI action matrix; S6 verifies equivalent read results and state changes through browser and CLI, including denied access; S7/S8 must include full user/admin CLI coverage in their adapter/MVP decisions. Existing supported CLI paths are reused rather than rebuilt.

Audience/interface requirement: Bashy is built for agentic tools to easily discover, use and manage all features through its CLI. Humans can also run the same CLI normally; it is not agent-exclusive, although human-oriented ergonomics are not its design priority. Bashy app/* web interfaces are designed to be human-friendly. Every web-visible capability and management action must have equivalent Bashy CLI support, with the same entities, permissions and approval rules. Agents may also inspect or operate web apps using bashy browser --live, REST APIs or web URLs; these are valid alternative paths, but can be more cumbersome or error-prone and do not substitute for CLI parity. Prioritize agent usability, discoverable help, scriptable/composable operations, structured inputs/outputs and actionable errors. Human TUI polish is not required; a CLI-only calendar does not supply the human-friendly web app.
